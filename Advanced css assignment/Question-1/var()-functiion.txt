Explain the purpose of using the var() function in css.
=> The var() function in css can be used to insert the value of a custom property instead of any part of
   a value of another property. It can not be used in property names, selectors or anything else besides
   property values. 
        This function accepts two parameters which are listed below:
        1. custom_property:It is required parameter. The names of the custom property must start with 
           two dashes(--).
        2. value: It is an optional parameter. It is used if the custom property is invalid.

     Syntax: var(custom_property, value)
         
          It allow us to reuse values, making easier to maintain consistency and if we need to design change 
          by make global change.
